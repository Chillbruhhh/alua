# Quality Assurance Guidelines

## 🛡️ Error Handling
- **Error Boundaries**: Implement React Error Boundaries for all major page components to gracefully handle UI errors.
- **API Error Handling**: All API calls must include robust error handling with user-friendly messages displayed to the frontend.

## ✅ Form Validation
- **React Hook Form + Zod**: Use React Hook Form for form management and Zod schemas for client-side and server-side validation.

## 🧐 Type Safety
- **No `any` Types**: Strictly avoid the use of `any` types. All variables, function parameters, and return types must be explicitly typed.
- **Interface Definitions**: Define clear and precise TypeScript interfaces for all data structures.

## 🧪 Testing (Future Consideration - Manual or Integrated)
- **Unit Tests**: While Bolt IDE doesn't currently support automated testing generation within the environment, the principle of writing unit tests for new features (functions, components, hooks) is critical for catching bugs early.
    - For now, this will be a manual step for developers. If Bolt IDE adds testing capabilities, integrate them here.
- **Test Scenarios**: Aim for at least one expected use case, one edge case, and one failure case for critical functions.

## 🔒 Security & Privacy
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Reiterate strict permissions for parent/student data access, enforced by Supabase RLS.
- **Data Encryption**: Consider data encryption for sensitive student information, especially if not handled directly by Supabase's encryption at rest.
- **FERPA Compliance**: Factor in FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) compliance considerations in all data handling and access patterns.
- **Secure File Uploads**: Implement secure file uploads for assignments, including considerations for virus scanning if externally hosted.
